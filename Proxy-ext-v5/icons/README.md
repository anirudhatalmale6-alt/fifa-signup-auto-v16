# Extension Icons

This directory should contain three icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using:
1. Any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Online icon generators
3. Simple colored squares with text/emoji

Suggested design: A network/proxy icon or simple geometric shape representing connection switching.

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders.
